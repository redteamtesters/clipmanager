The Clipboard Manager is a Python script that provides a command-line interface (CLI) to manage your clipboard content. It uses the `click` library to create a user-friendly CLI with the following features:

- **Show Clipboard Content**: View the current content stored in your clipboard.

- **Clear Clipboard**: Clear the clipboard, removing all the stored data.

- **Append Selection to Clipboard**: Append the current selection to the clipboard, allowing you to concatenate text or data.

    - *Optional*: Preview the combined content before copying it to the clipboard.

The script utilizes the `pyperclip` library to interact with the system clipboard and supports cross-platform functionality.

This Clipboard Manager simplifies clipboard management tasks, making it easier to view, clear, and manipulate clipboard contents from the command line.
